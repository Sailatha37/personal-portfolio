            <li>
                <strong>PIR Motion Sensing Circuit:</strong> Exploring Practical Applications and Real World Effectiveness
                <p>This project involves constructing a motion detector utilizing a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor alongside an LED indicator, both managed by an Arduino UNO. The PIR sensor detects infrared heat emitted by objects, and upon detecting motion, it activates the LED, providing immediate visual indication in real-time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Library Management System:</strong> Add, List, Search, and Count Books
                <p>This C program is designed to create a user-friendly library management system, facilitating efficient book management. Its primary functions include adding new books, displaying all available books, searching by author or title, and providing a total count of books. These features aim to simplify tasks for both librarians and users, enhancing the overall experience of book management.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Applications of First Order Differential Equations in Radioactive Decay</strong>
                <p>This project tells us how first-order differential equations serve as models for phenomena such as electronic explosions and radioactive decay. It investigates decay laws, half-life concepts, and their practical applications in areas like radio communications and medical diagnosis.</p>
